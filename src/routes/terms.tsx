          By using Klokk you agree to these terms. Klokk is provided by Pegasus Apps ("we", "us").
        </p>
        <h2 className="pt-2 font-display text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">The service</h2>
        <p>
          Klokk helps groups find a meeting time that works for most. Organisers create events and
          share a link; participants submit their availability without an account. Plans, prices and
          limits are described on our pricing page and may change with notice.
        </p>
        <h2 className="pt-2 font-display text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>
          Do not misuse Klokk, attempt to access other people's events or data, send unsolicited
          bulk invitations, or use the service for anything unlawful. We may suspend accounts that
          breach these terms.
        </p>
        <h2 className="pt-2 font-display text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">
          Your content and data
        </h2>
        <p>
          Event data is deleted automatically according to the retention periods in our Privacy
          Policy. Deletion cannot be undone, so keep your own record of anything you need.
        </p>
        <h2 className="pt-2 font-display text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">
          Contacting participants
        </h2>
        <p>
          When a participant responds to an event they may tick optional boxes that allow Klokk, and
          the organiser, to contact them about other events, marketing, newsletters and similar.
          Only participants who tick a box may be added to the related customer system. Organisers
          on a paid monthly plan can connect their own HighLevel account so consenting participants
          are added to it. By connecting, the organiser agrees to use those details lawfully, to
          honour unsubscribe and withdrawal requests, and to comply with the Spam Act 2001 and any
          other privacy and marketing law that applies to them.
        </p>
        <h2 className="pt-2 font-display text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">Ownership</h2>
        <p>
          Klokk and its source code, design and branding are owned by Pegasus Apps. All rights are
          reserved.
        </p>
        <h2 className="pt-2 font-display text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">Liability</h2>
        <p>
          Klokk is provided "as is". To the extent permitted by Australian Consumer Law, we are not
          liable for missed meetings or indirect loss. Nothing in these terms excludes rights you
          have under that law.
