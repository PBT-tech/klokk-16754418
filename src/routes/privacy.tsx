          Klokk is operated by Pegasus Apps (Canberra, Australia). We handle personal information in
          line with the Australian Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988, and apply GDPR
          principles as best practice for participants in the EU.
        </p>
        <h2 className="pt-2 font-display text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">What we collect</h2>
        <p>
          Organisers: Email address, a hashed password and an optional display name. Participants:
          first name, last name, email address, an optional mobile number, availability selections
          and any notes you choose to add. We do not collect payment card details (payments are
          handled by our payment provider) or any sensitive categories of personal information.
        </p>
        <h2 className="pt-2 font-display text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">How we use it</h2>
        <p>
          Your details are used to coordinate the meeting you were invited to, and to send related
          emails such as invitations, confirmations and reminders. They are shared with the event
          organiser and are not sold or shared with third parties for marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We keep the contact details of organisers and participants in our customer relationship
          management (CRM) system, which is provided by HighLevel and handles the information on our
          behalf. Because of this, you may be contacted by Klokk about Klokk and its potential to
          help you in your life and your business, for example with news, tips and offers. You can
          opt out of these messages at any time using the unsubscribe link in them, or by contacting
          us at the address below.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you respond to an event you can tick up to two optional boxes. Neither is ticked for
          you, and leaving them unticked does not affect your response or the emails about the
          meeting. Only people who tick a box are added to the matching customer system.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium text-foreground">Klokk may contact me.</span> We add your
            name and email to Klokk's own customer system and may contact you about Klokk.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium text-foreground">The organiser may contact me.</span> Where
            the organiser is on a paid monthly plan and has connected their own customer system,
            your name, email and, if you gave it, mobile number are added to it. The organiser may
            then contact you about other events, marketing, newsletters and similar.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The organiser is responsible for how they use details held in their own systems, and their
          copy is not covered by our retention periods below. You can withdraw either permission at
          any time: use the unsubscribe link in their messages, reopen your response link and untick
          the box, or contact us at the address below. We will pass on a withdrawal of the organiser
          permission where we can, but you may also need to ask the organiser directly.
        </p>

          How long we keep it
        </h2>
        <p>
          Events on the free plan, with all their responses and participant details, are deleted
          automatically 90 days after the event is created. Events on paid plans are deleted 12
          months after the event closes. Organisers can delete their account at any time, which
          removes their events and data.
        </p>
        <h2 className="pt-2 font-display text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">Your rights</h2>
        <p>
          You can ask to access, correct or delete your personal information, or complain about how
          it has been handled, by contacting us at the address below. If you are not satisfied you
          may contact the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.
        </p>
        <h2 className="pt-2 font-display text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">Data breaches</h2>
        <p>
          If a breach is likely to cause serious harm, we will notify affected people and the
          regulator as required by law.
